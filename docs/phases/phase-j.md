### **Summary of Final Refinements:**

| Category | Missing Consideration | Why It's Critical |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Performance & Resilience** | **Performance Baseline:** The plan tests functionality but not speed. A slow application can be just as detrimental as a buggy one, especially for a new product. | Establishing a performance baseline with tools like Lighthouse/PageSpeed Insights *before* launch gives us a benchmark to measure against and ensures we're not deploying a sluggish user experience. |
| **Operational Readiness** | **Backup & Restore Validation:** The plan includes backing up the database, but a backup is useless if it can't be restored. | A tested restore procedure is the cornerstone of any disaster recovery plan. This ensures we can *actually* recover from a catastrophic data loss event, which is non-negotiable for a service handling user data and payments. |
| **Observability** | **Sentry Source Map Verification:** The plan sets up Sentry but doesn't explicitly verify that source maps are correctly uploaded and applied. | Without source maps, Sentry's error stack traces are minified and unreadable, making the entire error tracking system nearly useless for debugging production issues effectively. |
| **Compliance & User Trust** | **Explicit User Consent:** The plan finalizes legal documents but doesn't specify how user consent is captured. | For regulations like GDPR, it is a legal necessity to have an explicit, auditable record of a user agreeing to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, typically via a mandatory checkbox during signup. |

By incorporating these final checks, we move from a plan for a successful launch to a plan for a **resilient, performant, and legally sound business operation**.

# **Phase J: Final Testing & Deployment Prep (v1.3)**

**Goal:** Ensure the Skinova application is stable, secure, performant, and ready for production. This involves comprehensive end-to-end testing, setting up robust observability and monitoring, finalizing compliance documentation, and configuring the production environment for a resilient launch.

**Associated Epic(s):** All Epics
**Estimated Duration:** 1 week

---

## `[ ]` 1. Comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Objective:** Validate all critical user flows and their failure modes in a production-like environment.

-   `[ ]` **Write E2E Test Suite (Playwright):**
    -   `[ ]` Test all "happy path" user flows (Onboarding, Analysis, Teledermatology, Dermatologist Portal, Settings).
    -   `[ ]` **[Added] Failure Path Testing:** Add specific tests to verify graceful error handling for key failures (e.g., a failed Stripe payment redirects correctly with an error message; a failed image upload shows a user-friendly toast).
-   `[ ]` **Execute Test Suite:** Run the full Playwright suite against a Vercel preview deployment.

## `[ ]` 2. Observability & Performance Validation

**Objective:** Ensure complete visibility into the application's health and establish performance benchmarks.

-   `[ ]` **Configure Sentry:**
    -   `[ ]` Verify production DSNs and create alerting rules for critical failures (billing, dermatologist portal).
    -   `[ ]` **[Refined] Verify Sentry Source Maps:** Manually trigger a test error from a production preview deployment and confirm in the Sentry dashboard that the stack trace is un-minified and maps correctly to the original source code.
-   `[ ]` **Configure Log Drains & Uptime Monitoring:** Set up log aggregation and external uptime monitoring.
-   `[ ]` **[Added] Establish Performance Baseline:**
    -   `[ ]` Run Google PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse against key pages (Homepage, Dashboard, Scan Page) on a Vercel preview deployment.
    -   `[ ]` Record the scores for Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices. The goal is to ensure scores are above 85 for all categories before launch.

## `[ ]` 3. Production Environment & Security Hardening

**Objective:** Finalize the production configuration and validate disaster recovery procedures.

-   `[ ]` **Create & Configure Production Supabase Project:** Set up the project, run migrations, and enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables with sensitive data.
-   `[ ]` **Configure Production Vercel & Stripe:** Set all production environment variables and configure Stripe for live mode with the correct webhook endpoint.
-   `[ ]` **[Refined] Key Rotation & Disaster Recovery:**
    -   `[ ]` Create and document the `docs/key-rotation-runbook.md`.
    -   `[ ]` **[Added] Test Backup & Restore Procedure:** Perform a manual backup of the (empty) production database schema. Then, perform a test restore into a separate, temporary database to validate that the backup files are valid and the procedure works. Document this process.
-   `[ ]` **[Added] Security Audit:** Run `npm audit --production` to check for known vulnerabilities in production dependencies and address any high-severity issues.

## `[ ]` 4. Compliance & Legal Finalization

**Objective:** Ensure all legal and privacy requirements are met before accepting users.

-   `[ ]` **Final Legal Review:** Get final sign-off on the Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Cookie Policy from legal counsel.
-   `[ ]` **[Refined] Implement Explicit Consent:**
    -   `[ ]` Add a mandatory checkbox to the signup form: "I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy."
    -   `[ ]` Ensure the "Sign Up" button is disabled until this box is checked.
-   `[ ]` **Finalize Dermatologist Contracts:** Confirm all partner dermatologists have signed their service contracts.

## `[ ]` 5. Pre-Launch Go/No-Go Checklist & Handoff

**Objective:** Conduct a final, formal review and define post-launch operational procedures.

-   `[ ]` **Go/No-Go Meeting:**
    -   `[ ]` Review E2E test results (both happy and failure paths).
    -   `[ ]` Review performance baseline scores.
    -   `[ ]` Confirm monitoring and alerts are active and tested.
    -   `[ ]` Confirm backup/restore procedure has been successfully tested.
    -   `[ ]` Get formal sign-off from all stakeholders.
-   `[ ]` **[Added] Post-Launch Handoff Plan:**
    -   `[ ]` Formally document the on-call schedule for the first two weeks post-launch.
    -   `[ ]` Define the process for escalating issues from customer support to the development team.
    -   `[ ]` Schedule the first post-launch retrospective meeting.

## `[ ]` 6. Phase Completion & Deployment

-   `[ ]` **Deploy to Production:** Merge the final branch into `main`.
-   `[ ]` **Post-Launch Monitoring:** Actively monitor all systems for the first 24-48 hours.
-   `[ ]` **Mark as Complete:** Mark this phase as complete, concluding the MVP development cycle and transitioning the project to a live operational state.
