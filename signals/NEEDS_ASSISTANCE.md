# Assistance Needed: Missing Master Plan File

**Issue:** The required file `docs/master_plan.md` could not be found. This file is essential for tracking phase completion status as per the project's hierarchical autonomous loop.

**Current Phase:** Phase L (After Implementation) tasks have been completed, but cannot be marked as such in the master plan.

**Request:** Please provide the `docs/master_plan.md` file or instructions on how to proceed with phase tracking.
